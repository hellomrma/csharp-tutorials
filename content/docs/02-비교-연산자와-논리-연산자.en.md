# 2. Comparison and Logical Operators

## Comparison Operators

Compare two values and return true or false.

### Size Comparison
- `>` : true if left is greater
  - Example: `8 > 10` → false (8 is less than 10)
  - Example: `2 < 5` → true (2 is less than 5)

### Equality Comparison
- `==` : true if two values are equal
  - Example: `5 == 5` → true
  - Example: `6 == 5` → false

- `!=` : true if two values are different
  - Example: `7 != 5` → true (7 and 5 are different)
  - Example: `7 != 7` → false (7 and 7 are the same)

### Greater or Equal, Less or Equal
- `<=` : true if left is less than or equal to right
  - Example: `3 <= 5` → true
  - Example: `3 <= 3` → true

- `>=` : true if left is greater than or equal to right
  - Example: `4 >= 4` → true
  - Example: `2 >= 4` → false

## Logical Operators

Used to combine multiple conditions.

### OR Operator (||)
- **Meaning**: "or" - true if at least one is true
- **Example**: `2 != 4 || 6 != 6`
  - `2 != 4` is true
  - `6 != 6` is false
  - Result: true (at least one is true)

**Real-life example**: "Take an umbrella if it's raining or windy"
- If raining → take umbrella (true)
- If windy → take umbrella (true)
- If neither → don't take umbrella (false)

### AND Operator (&&)
- **Meaning**: "and" - true only if both are true
- **Example**: `2 != 4 && 6 != 6`
  - `2 != 4` is true
  - `6 != 6` is false
  - Result: false (both are not true)

**Real-life example**: "Watch a movie if I have money and time"
- Have money and time → watch movie (true)
- No money or no time → don't watch movie (false)

### NOT Operator (!)
- **Meaning**: "not" - converts true to false, false to true
- **Example**: `!false` → true
- **Example**: `!true` → false

**Real-life example**: "Continue playing if game is not over"
- `!isGameOver` → true if game is not over
