# 2. Comparison and Logical Operators

## Comparison Operators

Compare two values and return true or false. Used in Unity to compare player health, score, level, etc.

### Size Comparison
- `>` : true if left is greater
  - Example: `playerHp > 0` → true if health is greater than 0 (alive)
  - Example: `currentScore > highScore` → true if current score is higher than high score

- `<` : true if left is less
  - Example: `enemyHp < 10` → true if enemy health is less than 10 (weak state)
  - Example: `playerLevel < maxLevel` → true if player level is below max level

### Equality Comparison
- `==` : true if two values are equal
  - Example: `playerHp == 0` → true if health is 0 (dead)
  - Example: `itemCount == maxInventorySize` → true if item count equals max inventory size

- `!=` : true if two values are different
  - Example: `playerHp != 0` → true if health is not 0 (alive)
  - Example: `currentWeapon != null` → true if current weapon exists

### Greater or Equal, Less or Equal
- `<=` : true if left is less than or equal to right
  - Example: `playerHp <= 30` → true if health is 30 or below (danger state)
  - Example: `enemyCount <= 0` → true if there are no enemies or count is 0

- `>=` : true if left is greater than or equal to right
  - Example: `playerLevel >= 10` → true if level is 10 or above (can level up)
  - Example: `score >= targetScore` → true if score meets or exceeds target score

## Logical Operators

Used to combine multiple conditions. Essential for creating complex game logic in Unity.

### OR Operator (||)
- **Meaning**: "or" - true if at least one is true
- **Game example**: 
```csharp
// If player is dead or game is over
if (playerHp <= 0 || isGameOver)
{
    ShowGameOverScreen();
}

// Jump if spacebar or left mouse button is pressed
if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space) || Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
{
    Jump();
}
```

**Unity usage**: 
- Check if any of multiple input keys are pressed
- Execute if any of multiple conditions are met
- Player is dead or time ran out, etc.

### AND Operator (&&)
- **Meaning**: "and" - true only if both are true
- **Game example**:
```csharp
// Can use skill if health exists and mana is sufficient
if (playerHp > 0 && playerMana >= skillCost)
{
    UseSkill();
}

// Give reward if level is 10+ and quest is completed
if (playerLevel >= 10 && questCompleted)
{
    GiveReward();
}
```

**Unity usage**:
- Execute only when all conditions are met
- Check if item can be used (item exists, no cooldown, etc.)
- Check if boss can be defeated (weapon exists, health exists, etc.)

### NOT Operator (!)
- **Meaning**: "not" - converts true to false, false to true
- **Game example**:
```csharp
// Continue playing if game is not over
if (!isGameOver)
{
    UpdateGame();
}

// Can attack if weapon is not null (weapon exists)
if (!(currentWeapon == null))
{
    Attack();
}

// Or more simply
if (currentWeapon != null)
{
    Attack();
}
```

**Unity usage**:
- Invert conditions
- Opposite of null check
- Execute when game state is not something
