# 12. Access Modifiers Deep Dive

## Types of Access Modifiers

Keywords placed before variables or functions to determine where they can be used.

## public (Public)

- **Description**: Accessible from anywhere
- **Unity Inspector**: Visible and editable
- **Other classes**: Accessible

```csharp
public class Human : MonoBehaviour
{
    public string myName;  // Visible in Inspector, accessible from other classes
    
    public void Eat() {   // Can be called from other classes
        Debug.Log("Eating");
    }
}
```

## private (Private)

- **Description**: Can only be used within the same class
- **Unity Inspector**: Not visible
- **Other classes**: Not accessible
- **Inherited classes**: Not accessible

```csharp
public class Human : MonoBehaviour
{
    private int myAge;        // Not visible in Inspector, not accessible from other classes
    private float myHeight;  // Not visible in Inspector
    
    private void Sleep() {    // Cannot be called from other classes
        Debug.Log("Sleeping");
    }
}
```

## When Access Modifier is Omitted

- **When nothing is written before variable or function**: Behaves the same as `private`
- **C# default**: Automatically becomes `private` when omitted

```csharp
public class Human : MonoBehaviour
{
    int myAge;        // Same as private (when omitted)
    float myHeight;   // Same as private (when omitted)
    
    void PowerPush() {  // Same as private (when omitted)
        Debug.Log("Pushing");
    }
}
```

## Access Modifier Comparison

| Access Modifier | Same Class | Child Class | Other Class | Unity Inspector |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| `public` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Visible |
| `private` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ Not visible |
| Omitted | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ Not visible |

## When to Use What?

### Use public
- When you want to set values in Unity Inspector
- When other scripts need to access it
- When child classes need to use it

### Use private
- Variables/functions used only within the class
- Important data that shouldn't be accessed externally
- When you want to increase code safety
